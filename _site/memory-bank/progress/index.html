<h1>Progress: Monochrome Flow</h1>
<h2>Current Status</h2>
<p>The project's memory bank has been successfully initialized. All core documentation files (<code>projectbrief.md</code>, <code>productContext.md</code>, <code>systemPatterns.md</code>, <code>techContext.md</code>, <code>activeContext.md</code>, <code>progress.md</code>) have been created and populated based on the <code>PROJECT_PAPER.md</code> document.</p>
<h2>What Works</h2>
<ul>
<li>The foundational documentation for the Monochrome Flow project is now in place, providing a comprehensive overview of its objectives, architecture, technologies, and current state.</li>
<li>The <code>memory-bank</code> directory structure is established.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What's Left to Build / Next Milestones</h2>
<ol>
<li><strong>Install Dependencies</strong>: Run <code>npm install</code> to set up the project's Node.js dependencies.</li>
<li><strong>Local Development Server</strong>: Start the local server with <code>npm run dev</code> to verify the basic Eleventy setup.</li>
<li><strong>Add First Portrait</strong>: Integrate an image and its corresponding markdown file into <code>src/portraits/</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Verify Content Integration</strong>: Confirm that the new portrait appears correctly on the local development server.</li>
<li><strong>Deployment Preparation</strong>: Ensure the project is ready for deployment to Netlify.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Known Issues</h2>
<ul>
<li>None at this initial stage, as no code has been executed or modified yet.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Evolution of Project Decisions</h2>
<ul>
<li>The decision to create a detailed memory bank at the outset is crucial for maintaining context and efficiency throughout the project's lifecycle, especially given the nature of my operation.</li>
</ul>
