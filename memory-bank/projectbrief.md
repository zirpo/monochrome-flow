# Project Brief: Monochrome Flow

## Core Objective

To create a minimalist, elegant, and automated portfolio website for monochrome photography using the Eleventy static site generator. The primary goal is to simplify the process of adding new photographic content, making it as straightforward as placing an image and a corresponding markdown file into a designated directory.

## Key Features

*   **Automated Content Integration**: New portraits are automatically integrated into the website by simply adding image and markdown files.
*   **Metadata-Driven Display**: Utilizes front matter in markdown files to display rich metadata (title, date, mood, camera, lens, etc.) alongside each portrait.
*   **Static Site Generation**: Leverages Eleventy for fast, secure, and easily deployable static website output.
*   **Customizable Design**: Provides clear pathways for customizing CSS, Nunjucks templates, and site metadata.
*   **Netlify Deployment**: Designed for seamless continuous deployment via Netlify from a GitHub repository.

## Project Scope

The project focuses on the core functionality of a photography portfolio: displaying images, associated metadata, and optional descriptions. It includes basic navigation and a gallery view. Advanced features like user authentication, comments, or complex e-commerce functionalities are out of scope.

## Target Audience

Photographers, particularly those focusing on monochrome work, who desire a simple, elegant, and low-maintenance online portfolio.
