# Progress: Monochrome Flow

## Current Status

The project's memory bank has been successfully initialized. All core documentation files (`projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, `techContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `progress.md`) have been created and populated based on the `PROJECT_PAPER.md` document.

## What Works

*   The foundational documentation for the Monochrome Flow project is now in place, providing a comprehensive overview of its objectives, architecture, technologies, and current state.
*   The `memory-bank` directory structure is established.

## What's Left to Build / Next Milestones

1.  **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` to set up the project's Node.js dependencies.
2.  **Local Development Server**: Start the local server with `npm run dev` to verify the basic Eleventy setup.
3.  **Add First Portrait**: Integrate an image and its corresponding markdown file into `src/portraits/`.
4.  **Verify Content Integration**: Confirm that the new portrait appears correctly on the local development server.
5.  **Deployment Preparation**: Ensure the project is ready for deployment to Netlify.

## Known Issues

*   None at this initial stage, as no code has been executed or modified yet.

## Evolution of Project Decisions

*   The decision to create a detailed memory bank at the outset is crucial for maintaining context and efficiency throughout the project's lifecycle, especially given the nature of my operation.
