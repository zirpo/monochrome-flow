# Active Context: Monochrome Flow

## Current Work Focus

The current focus is on initializing the project's memory bank and preparing the development environment.

## Recent Changes

*   The `memory-bank` directory has been created.
*   `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `systemPatterns.md`, and `techContext.md` have been created and populated with initial project documentation based on `PROJECT_PAPER.md`.

## Next Steps

1.  Complete the creation of the remaining core memory bank files: `activeContext.md` (this file) and `progress.md`.
2.  Install project dependencies using `npm install`.
3.  Verify the project setup by running the local development server with `npm run dev`.
4.  Add the first portrait and its corresponding markdown file as described in `PROJECT_PAPER.md`.

## Active Decisions and Considerations

*   **Memory Bank Structure**: Adhering to the defined memory bank structure to ensure comprehensive and easily retrievable project context.
*   **Documentation Accuracy**: Ensuring all information extracted from `PROJECT_PAPER.md` is accurately reflected in the memory bank files.

## Learnings and Project Insights

*   The project leverages Eleventy's data cascade and templating capabilities for automated content integration, which is a core strength.
*   The clear separation of content (markdown) and presentation (Nunjucks templates) is a key design principle.
